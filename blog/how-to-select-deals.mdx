To select specific deals to be displayed, you can configure the specific section as follows:
- Edit the section or add a new section
- Enable the `Sepcific Offer ID(s)` option
- Add the offer IDs you want to display, separated by commas

Only the specified deals will be returned and displayed as long as the cardholder is eligible for them. 
If a selected deal is segemented and the cardholder is not part of the target, the deal will not be displayed.

The deals order is not guaranteed. 
The deals are sorted by the order of relevance for the cardholder.
