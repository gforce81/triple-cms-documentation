# Rewards History

Displaying the Rewards History for a cardholder is optional. It can be enabled in the `Settings` menu.
<figure>
    <Image img={require('./images/rewards_history_1.png')} alt="Rewards history" style={{ marginTop: '20px', maxWidth: '600px'}}/>
    <figcaption style={{fontStyle: 'italic', fontSize: 'smaller', fontFamily: 'sans-serif', marginBottom: '50px'}}>Rewards history</figcaption>
</figure>

You can also control when a reward is displayed to a cardholder. 
Rewards can be shown as soon as Triple identifies a potential match between a transaction and a deal (`pending merchant approval`), or as late as when the funds are distributed to the cardholder (`distributed to cardholder`).
